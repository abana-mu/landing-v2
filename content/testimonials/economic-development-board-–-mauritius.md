  *The world is witnessing a new era of digital globalisation and consumer
  service revolution. This has allowed the development of Innovative Value
  Chains (IVC) where products are displayed on digital platforms in view to
  connect the demand with the supply side.*


  *The Fashion Industry is no exception. Its landscape is changing fast, particularly with the emergence of a new middle class in Africa that favours digital technology, which results in a growing number of consumers that is being facilitated through an improvement in electronic payment services.*


  *The advent of platforms like ABANA addresses a gap where manufacturers must develop a digital identity that can be connected directly to buyers to respond to their exigencies in fashion, taking into consideration the demand of the new generations. ABANA stands as a ‘one-stop shop’ to address the challenges of developing a world-class product from yarn to fashion, and gives a boost to Trade & Business with Africa. In this process, Mauritius leads the UNCTAD Productive Capacities Index standing as an unflinching partner and positions itself as a strategic hub for the region.*
